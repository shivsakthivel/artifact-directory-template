Title:
Exploring the viability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on a multi-label classification task to simultaneously detect Pulmonary Edema and Pleural Effusion

Abstract:
This project focuses on training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for a supervised classification task, specifically for predicting the presence of pulmonary edema and pleural effusion in chest radiographs. The project is a series of experiments to formulate a pipeline based on deep learning best practices, to achieve the best performing model for this multi-label classification task. The first experiment involved determining the appropriate application of transfer learning to chest radiograph image data. It was determined that the models should be trained through a serial unfreezing of the top layers in the ResNet152 architecture, at intervals of unfreezing one block of layers every 10 epochs with early stopping. The second experiment involved testing different formulations of the problem statement to achieve the best performing model. Separated binary label classifiers, a multi-label classifier and a multi-class classifier were all trained and evaluated using label prediction accuracy and the AUC (Area Under the Curve) of the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve which is a measure of the modelâ€™s discriminability. The multi-class classifier had the best overall performance, achieving an accuracy of 80% in the prediction of pulmonary edema and 83% in the prediction of pleural effusion, with the corresponding ROC AUC scores for both labels being 0.88 and 0.90 respectively.
